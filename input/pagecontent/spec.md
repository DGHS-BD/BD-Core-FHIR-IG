### A Heading
You can also use markdown if that's your thing

And an icon: ![resource](icon-resource.png)


You can also embed fragments of examples (or other resources)

As JSON:

{% include Patient-example-demo1-json-html.xhtml %}

{% include Patient-example-demo2-json-html.xhtml %}

or as XML:

{% include Patient-example-demo1-xml-html.xhtml %}

{% include Patient-example-demo2-xml-html.xhtml %}
