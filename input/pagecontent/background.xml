    The Bangladesh Core FHIR Implementation Guide defines national base
    profiles, code systems, and value sets to ensure interoperability across
    digital health systems under DGHS and MoHFW.
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    Bangladesh has multiple health information systems developed over the
    years, including DHIS2, multiple hospital automation systems, field automation systems, and HRIS. These systems use different data
    standards, which makes interoperability difficult. This guide aligns
    national systems with HL7® FHIR® R4 to ensure semantic consistency and
    facilitate integration with global initiatives.
  </p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Patient identity management (UHID, NID, BRN)</li>
    <li>Health facility and organization registry</li>
    <li>Immunization, laboratory, and condition profiles</li>
    <li>Terminology services (ICD-11, SNOMED subsets, local CodeSystems)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>National Digital Health Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows how FHIR-based services are integrated into
    Bangladesh's national digital health architecture:
