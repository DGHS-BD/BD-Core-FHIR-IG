  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The Bangladesh Core FHIR Implementation Guide (BD-Core-FHIR-IG) is part of the Bangladesh Digital Health Blueprint. It defines how health information should be exchanged across systems in Bangladesh in a safe, standardized, and interoperable way.
  </p>
  <p>
    By adopting international FHIR standards, this guide helps ensure that patient data can flow smoothly between hospitals, clinics, and national programs, while also enabling future cross-border health information exchange.

   This guide provides national FHIR profiles, value sets, and terminology bindings that software developers and system implementers must use when designing digital health applications for Bangladesh. Using these standards ensures consistency, reduces duplication, and supports patient-centered care.
